Guest Access Design

Guests join by clicking an invitation link received via email or shared by the organizer. No login or account setup is required. Their access is verified via the link itself. All interaction is handled from that link, including RSVP, polls, and updates.

Communication and Notification System

All event communication—RSVPs, confirmations, updates, and announcements—is sent via email. Guests are kept in the loop through automated or manual email blasts initiated by the organizer.

Scalability and Localization

Specyf is optimized for mobile-first experiences and can scale from small personal events to large multi-day conferences. It is built with both Indian and international users in mind and adapts well to localized event behavior.
